# This is the **about** page.

This page will explain what this site is **about**, what it will show you, how it is being built and with what software.

## First - The name of the site.
### As you may have noticed as you acessed the site the name is **gsb-wx.me** 
1. The gsb is from my initials of Gerald S Brown
2. The wx is an abreviation for **weather**
3. The .me is a cheap Top Level Domain (TLD) that is available from a domain register namecheap.com.

## Second - How it is being built.
### I am using 2 different editers to write the code for this site.
1. Geany - This is an editor I have used for a number of years as it is a plain text editor and **NOT** a word processing program which would put a lot of unneeded garbage in the file.
2.  PyCharm - This is a program that I have just started using as it helps to format the code in the file.
3. The program I am using to create this document is called **ReText** that is designed especially for creating **Markdown** files.  
These editers create simple text files that are in the **Markdown** format.

## Third - Program to convert the Markdown to HTML
### I am using a program called Hugo to convert the files from Markdown to HTML.
This program is called a Static Site Generator (**SSG**) which means there is **NO** database involved and the pages created are STATIC instead of being dynamic.

## Fourth - These files are created on two Raspberry Pi computers.  
 The first will be a Raspberry Pi model Zero -WH if the Philippine postal system will ever deliver it. On the shipping tracking I was told it left Manila on Jan 2, 2021 and as of this date (the date soldiers hate) March forth, 2021 it still has not arrived. Included in the package is a 0.5" x 1.0" sensor that mesures Humidity, Pressure and Temperature.
