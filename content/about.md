# This is the **about** page.

This page will explain what this site is **about**, what it will show you, how it is being built and with what software.

## First - The name of the site.
### As you may have noticed as you acessed the site the name is **gsb-wx.me** 
1. The gsb is from my initials of Gerald S Brown
2.  The wx is an abreviation for **weather**
3.  The .me is a cheap Top Level Domain (TLD) that is available from a domain register namecheap.com.

## Second - How it is being built.
### I am using 2 different editers to write the code for this site.
1. Geany - This is an editor I have used for a number of years as it is a plain text editor and **NOT** a word processing program which would put a lot of unneeded garbage in the file.
2.  PyCharm - This is a program that I have just started using as it helps to format the code in the file.
