# Home Page

This home page will lead you to all of the 20 content pages showing each of the weather conditions for the time frame specified.

## Summary

This is the main page for my web site gsb-wx.me which will present various readings for my home location of Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental, Philippines.

These readings will be read using a Raspberry Pi Zero-WH as soon as the Philippine Postal system delivers it along with the BME-280 sensor that I ordered from AdaFruit.com in NY, NY on Dec 14, 2020.  

The package was being tracked on-line and the last report was on Jan 2, 2021 when it said it was leaving Manila, Philippines for the  final destination of my home. As of Mar 8, 2021 I am still waiting for that package. 

As I have not yet received the above package I am using Python's Random Function to create random data to fill each of the charts much like the Main Stream Media in the US that generates their **FAKE** news segments that are filled with **LIES**. In the computer world it is known as **RANDOM DATA**.
